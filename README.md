 This repository hosts a Customer Churn Prediction model built using supervised machine learning techniques. The model analyzes historical customer data to identify patterns and factors influencing churn.
 ## Key Features
- **Data Exploration:** We dive into the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and explore patterns within the data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering are performed to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Model Selection:** Multiple machine learning algorithms are considered, including Logistic Regression, Gradient boosting, and Naive Bayes model. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizes model performance through hyperparameter tuning for enhanced accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Model Evaluation:** Model performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to gauge the model's predictive power.
- **Predictive Insights:** We provide insights into the most influential features contributing to Customer churn.

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook to access the project code and analysis.
- Run the notebook to perform data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
